# useWindowResize

Composable for listening to the window resize event, the event is debounced and the callbacks are called when it's finished.


```js
import { computed } from "vue";
import useWindowResize from "@ulu/frontend-vue/composables/useWindowResize.js;

const { 
  // Reactive Boolean
  isResizing, 
  // Method to register callback on start, returns a function to remove the listener
  onResizeStart, 
  // Method to register callback on end, returns a function to remove the listener
  onResizeEnd 
} = useWindowResize();

const removeStart = onResizeStart(() => {
  console.log("Resize started");
});
const removeEnd = onResizeEnd(() => {
  console.log("Resize is finished");
});
```
