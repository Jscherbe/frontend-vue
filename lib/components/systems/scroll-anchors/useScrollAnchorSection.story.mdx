# useScrollAnchorSection

A composable that provides the core logic for a scroll anchor section, allowing components to register themselves with the `UluScrollAnchors` parent and react to their active state.

This composable is intended to be used within a Vue component's `<script setup>` block to manage the lifecycle and state of a scrollable section.

## Usage

```html
<script setup>
import { useScrollAnchorSection } from './useScrollAnchorSection';

const props = defineProps({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  customTitleId: String,
});

const { sectionRef, titleId, isActive, section } = useScrollAnchorSection(props);
</script>

<template>
  <section :class="['my-custom-section', { 'is-active': isActive }]" :ref="sectionRef">
    <h2 :id="titleId">{{ title }}</h2>
    <p>This section is {{ isActive ? 'active' : 'inactive' }}.</p>
    <!-- More content here -->
    <slot />
  </section>
</template>
```

## Parameters

The `useScrollAnchorSection` composable accepts a `props` object with the following properties:

- `title` (String, required): The title of the section. Used for generating a default `titleId` and for display in navigation.
- `customTitleId` (String, optional): A custom ID for the section's anchor. If not provided, one will be generated from the `title`.

## Returns

The composable returns an object with the following reactive properties:

- `sectionRef`: A ref that should be bound to the root HTML element of your section component. This element is observed by `UluScrollAnchors` to determine the section's visibility.
- `titleId` (ComputedRef): The unique ID for the section's title, used for anchor links.
- `isActive` (ComputedRef): A boolean indicating whether the section is currently active (in view).
- `section` (Reactive): The full reactive section object registered with `UluScrollAnchors`, containing `id`, `title`, `titleId`, `element`, and `active` state.

## Integration with `UluScrollAnchors`

This composable works in conjunction with the `UluScrollAnchors` component. When a component using `useScrollAnchorSection` is mounted within `UluScrollAnchors`, it automatically registers itself. `UluScrollAnchors` then tracks its visibility and updates the `isActive` state.
