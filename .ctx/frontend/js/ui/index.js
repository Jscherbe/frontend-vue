/**
 * @module ui
 * @description
 * Public API for the UI modules.
 *
 * This file re-exports the internal implementations from the `ui` directory
 * with new names where appropriate, defining the public-facing API for the
 * library bundle.
 *
 * For internal library usage, import directly from the specific file within
 * the `ui` directory (e.g., `import { ... } from './dialog.js'`).
 *
 * @internal How to Name Exports
 *
 * Each export is renamed with a prefix based on its source module's name
 * (e.g., `init` from `dialog.js` becomes `dialogInit`). This is a critical
 * part of the library's bundling strategy, which creates a single, "flat"
 * module with uniquely named exports.
 *
 * This approach:
 * 1. Prevents name collisions between modules that might use the same export
 *    names (like `init` or `defaults`).
 * 2. Allows bundlers in consuming projects to perform dead-code elimination
 *    (tree-shaking) with maximum effectiveness.
 *
 * How To Add New Exports
 *
 * When adding a new export, follow the naming convention:
 * `[moduleName][OriginalExportName]` (using camelCase).
 *
 * For example, to export `myFunction` from `./foo.js`, you would add:
 * `myFunction as fooMyFunction`
 *
 * Please keep the exports within each block alphabetized.
